### 🧩 Notes:

* All features are **school-level** (not county-level) aggregates.
* Missing data were median-imputed for numeric variables and dropped for the target (`graduation_rate`).
* Highly correlated features (`avg_safety_score`, `pct_inexperienced`, etc.) were removed prior to modeling.
* Socioeconomic, staff quality, and engagement variables align with the **ABC framework** (Attendance, Behavior, Course performance).
