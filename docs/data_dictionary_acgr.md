Files include state, county, district, and school level data. Please refer to the file structure for details on what data are contained in the file. For more information about the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR) and Outcome Data, and for information about the Cohort Outcome Data calculated prior to 2016–17, please visit the Information about Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate web page.

This file contains aggregate data with disaggregated data subsets at multiple different levels and reporting categories to provide enhanced analytical flexibility. For more detailed examples about how to properly use these data, please refer to the Using the ACGR and Outcome Data File examples below.

Note: To protect student privacy, data are suppressed (\*) on the data file if the cell size within a selected student population (cohort students) is 10 or less. Additionally, the "Not Reported" race/ethnicity is suppressed, regardless of actual cell size, if the student population for one or more other race/ethnicity groups is suppressed.
