🎯 School-Level Graduation Risk Prediction
Users can interactively adjust key predictors to instantly estimate whether a school is At Risk or On Track.

📊 Real-Time Model Output  
The app automatically displays:

- Predicted risk category
- Model confidence / probability

🧮 Interactive Scenario Exploration
Users can simulate “what-if” scenarios such as:

- What if chronic absenteeism decreases?
- What if FRPM eligibility drops by 10%?
- How does the student-to-support-staff ratio impact graduation outcomes?

## 💻 Run locally

# 🎯 Project Intro / Objective

The main purpose of this project is to develop a school-level Early Warning System (EWS) that identifies California public high schools at risk of low graduation outcomes using only public, non-PII datasets. By leveraging statewide indicators aligned with the ABC framework—Attendance, Behavior, and Course performance—this project demonstrates that actionable early-warning signals can be generated without relying on restricted student-level records.

The goal is to provide California educators, policymakers, and district leaders with a scalable, transparent, and privacy-preserving tool for monitoring emerging risk, understanding systemic inequities, and supporting data-informed planning and resource allocation.

# 📘 Project Description

This project develops a simplified Early Warning System (EWS) that predicts high-school graduation outcomes using only publicly accessible datasets from the California Department of Education (CDE). Using 2021–22 school-level indicators—such as graduation rates, chronic absenteeism, FRPM eligibility, teacher experience, and school characteristics—combined with county-level climate data, we built a cleaned modeling dataset of 958 schools and 25 predictors. A binary target (“At Risk” < 90% graduation rate) highlighted a 26.3% minority class, and analysis confirmed strong ABC-aligned patterns between absenteeism, socioeconomic disadvantage, teacher experience, and graduation outcomes. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated with PR-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 due to class imbalance; Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best, with top predictors including chronic absenteeism, unexcused absences, FRPM eligibility, still-enrolled rate, and A–G completion rate. Key challenges included inconsistent county reporting, FERPA-related suppression, and missing climate indicators, though all data were aggregate and fully public.

# 📊 Dataset Summary

This project integrates multiple publicly accessible, non-PII datasets from the California Department of Education (CDE) and CalSCHLS to build a unified school-level dataset for modeling graduation outcomes. All data represent the 2021–22 school year, except for the CalSCHLS climate data (2017–19), which is the most recent available.

## 📁 Final Modeling Dataset

- **Total schools:** 958 California public high schools
- **Predictor variables:** 25 engineered and cleaned features
- **Target variable:**
  - **At Risk (1):** Graduation rate < 90%
  - **On Track (0):** Graduation rate ≥ 90%
- **Class balance:**
  - _On Track: 73.7%_
  - _At Risk: 26.3%_

## 🏆 Results

Using the top-15 features selected through Random Forest feature importance, seven classification models were evaluated on a stratified test set (20% split). Performance was compared using the PR-AUC as the primary metric due to class imbalance, with Precision, Recall, and F1-Score also included.

**Model Comparison (PR-AUC)**

The highest performing models were:

- **Random Forest** - PR-AUC 0.775
- **Logistic Regression** - PR-AUC 0.763
- **Naive Bayes** - PR-AUC 0.755

**Overall Finding**

Interpretability of the chosen model was not the highest priority since the predictions do not directly impact individual students. The **Random Forest** model delivered the strongest balance of precision and recall and the highest PR-AUC, making it the most reliable classifier for identifying schools `At Risk` of low graduation rates.
