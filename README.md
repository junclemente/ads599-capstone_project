# Project Title

This project is a part of the ADS-599 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

-- **Project Status: Planned**

# Installation

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```bash
git init
git clone https://github.com/junclemente/msads_capstone.git
```

## Environment Setup

This project uses a conda environment specified in a YAML file for
reproducibility and consistent development. Ensure you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or
[Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)
installed.

**Create the Environment**
Run the following:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Update the Environment (if needed)**
If there are any updates to the environment, you can update the environment with the following:

```bash
